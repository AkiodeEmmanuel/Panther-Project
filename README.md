# Panther-Project
# Pre-Lay Survey of Project Panther Flexible Pipelines  
### Malu 23 â€“ Malu Jkt 19, Malu 23 to OPOBO PP, Mejo 2 to EWAN PP  

## Project Overview  
The Pre-Lay Survey for Project Panther focused on processing and analyzing geophysical data to ensure the seabed was ready for flexible pipeline installation. The data processing phase aimed to generate accurate representations of seabed conditions and identify potential obstacles, providing critical insights for pipeline planning and installation.  

## Project Details  
- **Date:** March 2024  
- **Client:** Chevron Nigeria Limited  
- **Role:** Remote Data Processor  

## Responsibilities  
-  Analyzed processed geophysical data to identify seabed features, including obstacles, debris, and potential hazards along the pipeline route.  
-   Created and interpreted detailed profiles, charts, and maps to provide a comprehensive understanding of the seabed conditions.  
-  Developed Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) using multibeam data, ensuring precise seabed topography representation.  
-  Conducted in-depth analysis of side scan sonar imagery, sub-bottom profiles, and magnetic anomaly data to detect buried features and confirm the seabed's suitability for pipeline installation.  
- Prepared preliminary and final survey reports, documenting findings and recommendations for the client.  
 - Used AutoCAD to create detailed charts and diagrams, visually representing survey results for better client understanding and project planning.  

## Software Used  
- **EIVA NaviPac, NaviEdit, Navimodel:** For navigation data processing, integration, and 3D modeling.  
- **Sonawiz 6:** For side scan sonar data processing and analysis.  
- **AutoCAD:** For creating precise charts and diagrams.  

## Outcome  
The processed data provided Chevron Nigeria Limited with a comprehensive understanding of the seabed, enabling informed decisions during pipeline installation. The survey ensured potential hazards were identified and mitigated, supporting a seamless and efficient project execution.
